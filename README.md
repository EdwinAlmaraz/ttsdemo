This is a demo using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech to synthesize strings read from a Google Sheets spreadsheet and write the resulting audio to MP3 files in Google Drive. It has rudimentary change tracking by checksums. See the basic usage by running `go run ./tts.go --help`.  

The associated Level Up episode, with hands-on walkthrough of usage, can be viewed on the [Google Cloud APAC YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/aMRqPGD0_To)
